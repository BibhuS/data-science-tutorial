    "* Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting data\n",
    "* Inspiration of Statistics\n",
    "  * Data collected from any event happening around the world\n",
    "    * Ex: Manufacturing - Volume of coke in manufactured coke bottles, Weight of chips pack\n",
    "    * Restaurant - No. of items ordered by a customer\n",
    "    * Traffic - Amount of time taken to go from point A to point B\n",
    "    * Plant growth - Height of sapling at germination\n",
    "* How Statistics works?\n",
    "  * It starts with a problem statement\n",
    "  * It starts with a population related to the problem statement. Ex. Chips packs manufactured in a factory\n",
    "  * It draws samples from the population. Ex. 10 or 20 or 30 or 50 chips packs (randomly)\n",
    "  * It calculates some metrics (in this case measures of central tendencies). Ex. mean of pack weights, variance of weights, standard deviation of weights\n",
    "  * It employs mechanisms to infer the same measures of central tendency for the population based on the driven samples\n"

    "* Probability is a mathematical language used to discuss uncertain events and probability plays a key role in statistics. Any measurement or data collection effort is subject to a number of sources of variation. By this we mean that if the same measurement were repeated, then the answer would likely change. Statisticians attempt to understand and control (where possible) the sources of variation in any situation."

    "* Goal is to estimate mean of a population. Please note that the population could be so huge that it is not practically possible to know each value and thus calculate the mean. Hence, this needs to be estimated\n",

    "* Draw sufficiently large number of samples\n",
    "* The Central Limit Theorem says that :\n",
    "  * If no. of samples drawn is sufficiently large (N > 30), then the average of means of the samples comes very close to the mean of the population\n",
    "  * Given the values N = size of the sample, x(bar) = mean of the sample and s = standard deviation of the sample\n",
    "    * The spread of the sample will be less compared to the population\n",
    "    * The sampling distribution will follow a normal distribution\n",
    "    * The bigger the sample, the smaller the spread\n",
